## Poster Size
- The first thing that came to my mind is the years in Paris that occur in the movie. The poster size is 2010 × 1920 pixels. 2010 represents modern Paris in the main timeline, and 1920 is the year Gil travels back to.

## Overall Poster
- The atmosphere around the main character, Gil, is in a blue shade to represent midnight and modernity. However, the river in the middle of the poster has a slight yellow shade to reflect the moonlight and symbolize the nostalgia and memorable history that Gil travels back to. Moreover, the pathway that Gil walks past and the tower are in the style of Starry Night, representing the surrealism, chaos and imagination of his journey through time. 
- In the river, Gil's shadow in 1920s Paris is reflected, turning back to look at the shadows of famous artists from the era. This signifies that he is still drawn to the past, even though he ultimately chooses to live in the present and overcomes his lack of confidence in his work (his fiction).

## Font
- I used a handwritten font for the movie title to represent Gil's dream of becoming a fiction writer. I also emphasized the letters "M" and "P" in bold to highlight "**M**odern Paris" and "**P**ast Paris" as a subtle detail in the title. Moreover, the tagline, "What if the past was never just a memory?" is placed subtly at the bottom, prompting viewers to think about the film’s central mystery. I chose different fonts for the words "past" and "memory" — a painterly, hand-drawn script font — to connect to the Impressionist/Post-Impressionist art styles. The fonts give an artistic and nostalgic feeling.
